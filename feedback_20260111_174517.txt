suggestions for improvement:
- The `fetch_readable` endpoint currently truncates the fetched text to 8000 characters. Consider using a proper HTML parsing library like `beautifulsoup4` to extract the main content more effectively instead of a simple truncation.  This could improve the summarization quality.
- In `fetch_readable`, the title defaults to the URL if the actual title cannot be extracted. Implement logic to extract the title from the HTML content.  This will lead to a better briefing document.
- The summarization prompt could be improved by providing more specific instructions about the format of the inline citations (e.g., always use square brackets).  Also, consider adding a temperature parameter to the summarization request to control the randomness of the output.
- Consider adding logging to the server to help with debugging and monitoring.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a more robust argument parsing library for the CLI, instead of directly using sys.argv.
- Add error handling around the HTTP requests to gracefully handle network issues or server errors.
- Consider adding logging to help debug any issues that might arise.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided notebook appears to contain only a sample output file in Markdown format, rather than any code implementing the server, client, or API interactions described in the chapter content.
- There is no implementation of the required HTTP endpoints, search API calls, LLM integration, or file saving functionality.
- The notebook does not address the core requirements of the daily challenge.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code defines environment variables, which is related to setup but doesn't implement any of the core functionalities described in the problem statement (HTTP API endpoints, CLI client, etc.).
- The code should implement the server and client logic as specified in the problem description, not just define environment variables.
